<b>What I have learned about the Web</b>
<p>The Web is a collection of HTML documents that includes hyperlinks, or links for short.  One can view HTML documents using a browser 
  such as Firefox, Chrome, or my new preference Safari.  Browsers connect to the internet to acquire files that are hosted on computers
  known as servers.  All of this is done by using HTTP; a protocol that allows for the communication between a browser and server.  
</p>
<br><b>What I have learned about HTML </b> <em>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</em>
<br> HTML is straightforward <br>
<br> <em><b>Tags</b></em> are used to format HTML <em><b>Elements</b></em><br>
<br>An<em><b> Element</b></em> is contained by an opening tag and a closing tag.<br>
<br><em><b>Anchor Tags</b></em> are utilized to include links to other websites. 

   <br> Please click on the following link to learn more about anchor tags. <a href = "http://help.typepad.com/anchor-tags.html">Anchor Tags Tutorial</a><br>
   <br><b>General Comment:</b>Since programmers cannot remember everything there are a wealth of resources on the internet.  When a programmer
   forgets a tag or a method of accomplishing a program then he or she must be able to look it up by using the internet, a book, or perhaps a colleague.<br> 
   <br><em><b>White Space</b></em> is controled by including <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b> elements.<br>
   <br> The break is an example of an <b>inline</b> tag and the paragraph tag is an example of a <b>block</b> tag.<br>

   <br><b>Questions and comments of what I learned:</b>
    <p> HTML is straight forward and requires that I know how to use tags to format a webpage, 
    is there software that allows for easier editing of HTML code?  
    I mean an editor that allows me to easily search for tags from a menu. Will I learn how to make a web page more dynamic with animations and moving objects? 
    Is there a standard of how I format a web page so that it is visually pleasing?  I don't know if what I created does the job with organization and structure? 
    Well those are the questions and comments that I have.  Thanks for commenting on this.
